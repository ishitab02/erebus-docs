            You need two identities, because a negotiation has two sides and each one settles from
            its own notes. Follow <a href="/" className="link">the quickstart</a> twice, once
            per identity, into two separate state directories. Then shield funds on the payer
            side, which also registers the identity and makes it available as a counterparty.

              The payee needs an allowance for <strong>two</strong> charged writes, its own open

              The pool fee is pulled from the identity&rsquo;s <strong>public</strong> STRK
              balance. A healthy shielded balance does not cover it, and neither does a large
              allowance. <code>doctor</code> reports this case as a <code>gas_balance</code>{" "}

            <strong>Both sides open their own direction.</strong> This is not optional and it is
            the single most common first-run mistake. A one-sided open leaves the counterparty
            with <code>unknown channel handle</code>, and a payee that never opens cannot see the
            offer it is meant to answer.

          <p className="prose mt-6 max-w-[62ch]">
            The payer calls <code>get_note_balance</code> before naming a price, because it is the
            side that has to cover it. Amounts here are base units, so the values above are 0.6
            and 1.0 STRK. The exact prices and deadlines belong in your agent policy. What matters
            for the shape of the run is the lifecycle, not the numbers.

            Every write takes an <code>operation_id</code>. Persist it, and the intent behind it,

            Only the payer settles, because <code>accept_and_settle</code> spends the
            caller&rsquo;s notes. A payee leaves its final offer for the payer to accept.

            Settlement consumes the payer&rsquo;s notes, creates the payee&rsquo;s note, returns
            change if the inputs overshot, and leaves the channel pair open for later deals. The

            <code>grant_viewing_key</code> writes a grant file scoped to one deal and one
            registered recipient, with an explicit expiry. <code>reveal</code> reads it back and
            reconstructs that deal. Neither touches the chain, so neither costs gas.
          </p>
          <p className="prose mt-4 max-w-[62ch]">
            Four properties are worth stating to whoever receives the grant: it is scoped to one
            deal, it has an expiry, it carries no spending authority, and the recipient&rsquo;s
            pool key must match the one the grant names. Opening a disclosure does not erase what
            was already disclosed.
